# üìò Introduction to Postprocessors

## üï∞Ô∏è Historical Background

As CSS development became more complex (around 2012‚Äì2015), developers realized that writing better CSS was not enough ‚Äî  
they also needed tools to **improve the CSS after it was written**.

This led to the rise of **Postprocessors** ‚Äî tools that process regular `.css` files and:

- Improve browser compatibility
- Optimize performance
- Enhance future syntax support
- Shrink file size for faster loading

Unlike preprocessors (like Sass, LESS, Stylus) which help during writing,  
**postprocessors work after** the CSS is already written.

## üìå What Postprocessors Typically Do

| Task                              | Example Tool           |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Add vendor prefixes automatically | Autoprefixer           |
| Minify CSS to reduce file size    | cssnano                |
| Allow using future CSS safely     | cssnext (historically) |
| Flip layouts for RTL languages    | rtlcss                 |
| Remove unused CSS                 | PurgeCSS               |
| Merge duplicate media queries     | mqpacker               |

‚úÖ Postprocessors operate on **finished** CSS ‚Äî they polish it for real-world use.

## üí¨ Why Are Postprocessors Important?

- **Browser compatibility**: Automatically add vendor prefixes.
- **Performance**: Minify and optimize CSS for faster loading.
- **Future-proofing**: Allow you to use newer CSS features safely.
- **Automation**: Reduce human error by handling repetitive tasks.

## üî• Difference Between Preprocessors and Postprocessors

| Aspect           | Preprocessors                                 | Postprocessors                                 |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| When applied     | Before writing CSS                            | After writing CSS                              |
| Purpose          | Easier authoring (variables, mixins, nesting) | Improve final CSS (prefixes, minify, optimize) |
| Input file types | `.scss`, `.less`, `.styl`                     | `.css`                                         |
| Output           | Clean, compiled CSS                           | Optimized, production-ready CSS                |
