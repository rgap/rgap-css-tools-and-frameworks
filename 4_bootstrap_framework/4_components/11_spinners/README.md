# 📘 Bootstrap Components — Spinners

## 🕰️ Historical Context

Before Bootstrap, creating a loading spinner involved:

- Creating custom CSS animations.
- Handling different sizes, colors, and accessibility manually.

✅ Bootstrap introduced **Spinners** as ready-made loading indicators.

## 📦 How Bootstrap Spinners Work

Spinners are simple `<div>` elements with spinner-specific classes:

| Purpose              | Class Example     |
| :------------------- | :---------------- |
| Border spinner       | `spinner-border`  |
| Grow spinner         | `spinner-grow`    |
| Visually hidden text | `visually-hidden` |

✅ The spinner shows an animated loading circle.
✅ Text inside `<span>` improves screen reader accessibility.

## 📄 Basic Spinner Examples

### Border Spinner

```html
<div class="spinner-border" role="status">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
</div>
```

### Grow Spinner

```html
<div class="spinner-grow text-primary" role="status">
  <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
</div>
```

✅ The `spinner-border` spins clockwise.
✅ The `spinner-grow` pulses to indicate loading.

## 🔧 How Bootstrap Enhances Spinners

- Easy color customization using text utility classes (e.g., `text-primary`, `text-success`).
- Size adjustments using `.spinner-border-sm` or `.spinner-grow-sm`.
- Full accessibility with hidden loading text.

---

## 💡 Quick Concept

Spinner = **`spinner-border`** or **`spinner-grow`** + _(optional)_ color and size utilities.

- Maintain consistent, professional UI feedback.
