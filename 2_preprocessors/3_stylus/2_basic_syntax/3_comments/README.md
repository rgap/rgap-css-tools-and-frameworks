# 📘 Comments in Stylus

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

Stylus supports two types of comments:

---

## ✍️ Comment Types

- `// Single-line comments`
  - Used during development
  - ❌ **Do not appear** in the compiled CSS
- `/* Multi-line comments */`
  - ✅ **Will appear** in the final CSS output

## 💡 Best Practices

- Use `//` for notes and debugging
- Use `/* */` for documentation that needs to stay in production CSS
