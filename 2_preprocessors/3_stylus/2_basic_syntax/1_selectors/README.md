# ðŸ“˜ Basic Selectors in Stylus

## ðŸ§  What This Demonstrates

This example shows that **Stylus** can start just like CSS â€”  
but without needing `{}`, `;`, or even `:` thanks to indentation.

## âœ… Key Points

- Stylus uses indentation instead of braces and semicolons
- Selectors and properties are written hierarchically
- Very clean and readable for simple CSS

---

## ðŸ“„ Example

```stylus
body
  background-color #f9f9f9
  color #333
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why Start Here?

- Minimal differences from traditional CSS
- Smooth learning curve for beginners
- Focus on the idea that Stylus simplifies CSS without changing its structure too much
