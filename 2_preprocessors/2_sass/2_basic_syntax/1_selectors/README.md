# 📘 Basic Selectors in SCSS

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

This example shows that **SCSS starts out exactly like CSS**.  
You can write plain CSS inside a `.scss` file and it will work the same.

## ✅ Key Points

- SCSS is a **superset** of CSS — any valid CSS is valid SCSS.
- You can gradually migrate from CSS to SCSS by renaming the file and using new features step-by-step.

## 💡 Why Start Here?

Understanding that SCSS doesn't require special syntax from the start makes it beginner-friendly.  
You can adopt it progressively without breaking your existing styles.

## ⚙️ How to Compile

```bash
sass styles.scss styles.css
```
