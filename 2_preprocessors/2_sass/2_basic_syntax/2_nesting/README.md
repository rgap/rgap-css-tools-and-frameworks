# 📘 Nesting in SCSS

## 🧠 What This Demonstrates

SCSS allows you to **nest CSS rules inside selectors**, mirroring your HTML structure.

This means you don’t have to repeat the entire selector every time.

## ✅ Why It’s Useful

- Reduces repetition
- Improves readability and hierarchy
- Keeps related styles visually grouped

## ⚠️ Best Practice

Try to keep nesting to 2–3 levels max.  
Deep nesting can make debugging and overrides more difficult.
