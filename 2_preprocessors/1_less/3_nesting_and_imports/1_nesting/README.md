# ðŸ“˜ Nesting in LESS

## ðŸ§  What This File Demonstrates

LESS allows you to **nest CSS rules** inside selectors, following the structure of your HTML.

## âœ… Example

````less
article {
  h2 {
    color: blue;
  }
}

Compiles to:

```css
article h2 {
  color: blue;
}
````

## ðŸ“Œ Why It's Useful

- Keeps related styles visually grouped
- Reflects HTML structure
- Reduces duplication in complex layouts
