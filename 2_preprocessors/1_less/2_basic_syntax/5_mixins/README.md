# 📘 LESS Mixins

## 🧠 What This File Shows

This file introduces **mixins** in LESS — reusable groups of CSS rules.

## ✨ What are mixins?

Mixins are like **functions** for your styles.  
They let you write a block of styles once and reuse it anywhere.

## ✅ Example

```less
.card-style() {
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  background-color: white;
}

.card {
  .card-style();
}
```
