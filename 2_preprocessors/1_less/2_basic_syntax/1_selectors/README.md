# ðŸ“˜ Basic Selectors in LESS

## ðŸ§  What This Demonstrates

This file shows that **LESS syntax starts out exactly like CSS**. You can use all CSS selectors and styles with no changes.

## âœ… Key Points

- LESS is a superset of CSS
- Any `.less` file can contain plain CSS and will work fine
- This makes it easy to gradually migrate to LESS from a CSS codebase

## ðŸ’¡ Why Start Here?

Understanding that LESS doesn't require special syntax from the beginning builds confidence. You donâ€™t need to learn new keywords just to start using `.less` â€” you can begin with what you already know.
