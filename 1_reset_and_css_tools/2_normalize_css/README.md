# 📘 Normalize.css

## 🕰️ Historical Context

Normalize.css was created by **Nicolas Gallagher** in **2011** as a more nuanced alternative to Reset CSS. Rather than removing all default styles, Normalize **preserves useful defaults** and **fixes cross-browser bugs**.

It quickly became the default "base" stylesheet for many frameworks and developers who wanted a consistent but usable starting point.

## 🎯 Purpose

Normalize.css aims to:

- Fix visual inconsistencies across browsers
- Preserve useful defaults like `list-style` and `heading` spacing
- Improve **accessibility** and **readability**
- Be more maintainable than a full reset

## ✅ What It Fixes or Normalizes

- Line height and font rendering across browsers
- Text resizing quirks in mobile browsers
- Element `display` settings (e.g., HTML5 elements)
- Table spacing and border behavior
- List indentation and bullets
- Form element consistency

## 💡 Use Cases

- Web apps that **retain semantic defaults**
- Projects that want **default browser behavior but consistent**
- Often used **alongside preprocessors** (like Sass) or **frameworks** (like Bootstrap or Tailwind)

- `normalize.css`: The stylesheet with comments preserved
- `index.html`: A visual demo of its default-preserving behavior
