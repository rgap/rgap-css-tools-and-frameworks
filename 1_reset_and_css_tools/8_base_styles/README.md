# 📘 Base Styles

## 🕰️ Context

After applying a **reset**, many developers define a set of **base styles**  
to ensure consistent typography, spacing, and basic UI appearance.

This became common with **CSS Methodologies** like SMACSS and BEM around **2010-2012**.

## 🎯 Purpose

Base styles:

- Create a predictable, clean starting point
- Improve text readability and layout defaults
- Define visual tone (font, link color, base spacing)

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Standardized `font-family`, `font-size`, and `line-height`
- Clear defaults for headings, paragraphs, links, lists, and images
- Accessible and consistent foundation for any design system

## ✅ Use Cases

- Corporate websites
- Blogs and articles
- Any project that values **good typography and readability**

## 📁 Included Files

- `base.css`: A basic setup of default styles
- `index.html`: Demo applying these base styles
