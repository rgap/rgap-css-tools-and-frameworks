# 📘 Custom CSS Reset

## 🕰️ Context

Sometimes developers create their own **custom minimal resets**  
to better fit their specific project needs without importing large files.

This approach became more common after **2015**,  
when modern browsers reduced inconsistencies by default.

## 🎯 Purpose

This custom reset:

- Fixes only essential inconsistencies
- Preserves helpful browser defaults (like basic list styles)
- Sets up a simple, clean foundation

## ⚙️ Key Features

- Universal `box-sizing: border-box`
- Reset margins and padding on common text elements
- Normalize images and form elements
- No excessive resets — lightweight and project-specific

## ✅ Use Cases

- Small personal projects
- Custom design systems
- When **full resets** (Normalize, Reset.css) are **too heavy**

## 📁 Included Files

- `custom-reset.css`: Your personal reset stylesheet
- `index.html`: Demo using the custom minimalist reset
