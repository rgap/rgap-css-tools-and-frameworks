# 📘 Introduction to Tailwind CSS

## 🕰️ Historical Context

**Tailwind CSS** was released in **2019** by a small team led by **Adam Wathan** (Tailwind Labs).  
It emerged as a response to the limitations developers faced with traditional CSS frameworks and custom CSS.

By the late 2010s, frameworks like Bootstrap had become popular for quickly building UIs, but many developers found themselves:

- **Overriding default styles** to match custom designs
- Writing lots of **custom CSS** for unique components
- Reusing similar utility snippets (small CSS chunks) across projects

✅ **Need for a new approach:** The creators of Tailwind wanted a way to **speed up development** without imposing a specific look or requiring extensive CSS writing. They drew inspiration from the **“utility-first”** (or _atomic CSS_) movement, aiming to make it mainstream and developer-friendly.

## 💡 The Utility-First Philosophy

Tailwind’s core idea is **utility-first CSS**. This means it provides **tiny, single-purpose classes** (utilities) to style elements, instead of pre-designed components.

- **No pre-styled components**
- **Compose your design**
- **No opinionated themes**

✅ _Example:_

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded">Save</button> <button class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
```

## 🆚 Tailwind CSS vs. Bootstrap

| Aspect         | **Bootstrap 😃**                         | **Tailwind CSS 🎨**             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Style Method   | Pre-built _component_ classes            | Utility classes                 |
| Design Freedom | Limited by predefined themes             | Total design freedom            |
| Customization  | Sass variables / custom CSS              | Fully customizable via config   |
| File Size      | Large unless trimmed                     | Small via JIT and purging       |
| Learning Curve | Easy to start, tricky to override deeply | Steeper start, faster long-term |
