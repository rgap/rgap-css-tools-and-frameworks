# 🌱 Tailwind CLI — @tailwind base

This folder demonstrates how to use only the `@tailwind base` directive with the Tailwind CLI.

---

## 🎯 What Is `@tailwind base`?

The `@tailwind base` directive:

- Injects **Preflight**, Tailwind’s modern CSS reset (built on top of `normalize.css`).
- Applies minimal, opinion-free styles to base HTML elements like `<body>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, forms, and more.
- Ensures a **consistent and clean foundation** for your UI before you apply utilities or components.

---

## ❗ Why It Matters

- Avoids unexpected browser styles (e.g., margins on `<h1>`, bullet styles on `<ul>`, default button padding).
- Makes all Tailwind utilities behave **predictably**.
- Applies essential tweaks like:
  - `box-sizing: border-box`
  - Standardized font settings
  - Input and form element normalization

✅ Always use `@tailwind base` **at the top** of your CSS so utilities and components can override where needed.

---

## ⚠️ What Happens Without It?

- Browser styles will vary and may conflict with utility classes.
- Your layout and spacing may be inconsistent.
- You’ll need to manually reset or override defaults in your own CSS.

---

## 📄 Example Output

You’ll see:

- Headings with no default top margin
- Paragraphs and lists without extra spacing or bullets
- Forms and buttons reset to a minimal, neutral appearance

➡️ No utility classes are used in the HTML, yet the page looks clean and consistent.

## 📂 Files in This Folder

- `input.css` – contains only `@tailwind base`
- `index.html` – basic HTML structure (headings, paragraphs, lists)
- `output.css` – compiled CSS (generated by Tailwind CLI)
- `tailwind.config.js` – tells Tailwind to scan `index.html`

---

## 🚀 How to Run It

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

Then open `index.html` in your browser.

✅ You’ll see the effect of Tailwind’s base layer even with zero utility classes.
