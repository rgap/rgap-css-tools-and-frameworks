# ðŸ”Œ Tailwind CLI â€” @tailwind components + Plugins

This folder demonstrates how to use the `@tailwind components` layer along with an official plugin: `@tailwindcss/forms`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ What Plugin Is Used?

Weâ€™re using [`@tailwindcss/forms`](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins#forms) to normalize and simplify default form styles.

It automatically applies better base styles to `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, etc., so they look consistent and more polished across browsers.

---

## ðŸ§© How It Works

In `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
const forms = require('@tailwindcss/forms');

module.exports = {
  content: ["./index.html"],
  plugins: [forms],
}
```

- The plugin injects styles into the `@tailwind components` layer.
- It gives Tailwind a **better baseline** for form fields.
- You donâ€™t need to manually style every form element â€” the plugin handles good defaults.

---

## ðŸ“„ Example Output

When you open the form in `index.html`, youâ€™ll see:

- Inputs with clean borders
- Focused inputs with visible outlines
- No browser-inconsistent styles

These styles come from the plugin â€” **not from utility classes**.

## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Folder

- `index.html` â€“ A simple form
- `input.css` â€“ Includes all Tailwind layers
- `tailwind.config.js` â€“ Loads the forms plugin
- `output.css` â€“ Generated file (after CLI run)

---

## ðŸš€ How to Run It

Install the plugin:

```bash
npm install -D @tailwindcss/forms
```

Then run:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

âœ… The form in your HTML will now have improved, normalized styles thanks to the plugin.
